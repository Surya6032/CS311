Magnetic Disk(spinners)
Solid State(SSD)

Disks are random access devices.(Direct access)
Data is organized into directly addressable chunks called sectors.
Each sector is portion of concentric circle on the disk platter called a track.

When a disk has multiple platters, the collection of tracks directly above each other are called cylinders.

Sectors are consecutively numbered starting at zero from outermost edge.
Sectors may not be consecutive on the tracks(interleaving).
