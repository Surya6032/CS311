Abstraction levels of a modern computer

It has 6 levels.
6  User Applications
5  High level languages C/C++, GO, Java, etc.
4  Low level language Assembler
3  System softwar OS, system utils
2  Machine Instruction set architecture(ISA)
1  Control Hardwired  or microcode
0  Digital logic gates and circuits

What is an algebra?
Symbols and rules for manipulating symbols

What is programming?
Symbols and rules for manipulating symbols

Boolean Algebra - symbols can take on two values, by convention we use zero(False) and one(True)

Operations from boolean algebra:
AND
OR
NOT

Boolean identities

Name 		  AND form 		     Or form
Identity	  1x=x			      0+x=x
Null		  0x=0                1+x=1
Idempotent	  xx=x			      x+x=x
Inverse	      xx'=0               x+x'=1
Commutative   xy=yx               x+y=y+x
Associative  (xy)z=x(yz)         (x+y)+z=x+(y+z)
Distributive  x+(yz)=(x+y)(x+z)	  x(y+z)=xy+xz
Absorption    x(x+y)=x			  x+xy=x
DeMorgan's    (xy)'=x'+y'         (x+y)' x'+y'
Involution	  			(x')'=x


What is the precedence of Boolean operations?
NOT, AND, OR

F_1(x,y,z) = x + y'z

X   Y  Z  F_1
0   0  0   0
0	0  1   1		
0	1  0   0
0  	1  1   0
1	0  0   1
1   0  1   1
1	1  0   1
1	1  1   1
