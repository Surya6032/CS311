### Virtual Memory
The address the process uses, generated by the CPU
Physcial address - The real address in physcial memory 
Mapping - translate virtual addr to real addr
Page frames - equal size chunks of main memory
Page - chunk of virtual memory 
Paging - the process of copying a page to a page frame
fragmentation - When memory become seperated into unusable sized chunks.
Page fault - an event that occurs when a requested page is not in a page frame.

A cached page table is called a translation lookaside buffer TLB.
1. Extract the page number from the virtual address.
2. Extract the offset from the virtual addr.
3. Search for the virtual page number in the TLB.

Hit: add the offset to the physical frame number
Miss: got to the page table and get the frame number, if the frame is in memory add the offset,
      otherwise page fault.
      
#### TLB is usual composed of CAM (content addressable memory)
